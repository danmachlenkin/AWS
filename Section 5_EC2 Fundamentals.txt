EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud

-EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options:
*Operating System: Windows, Linux, MacOS
*How much compute power & cores (CPU)
*How much random access memory (RAM)
*How much storage space: Network attached (EBS & EFS) , Hardware (EC2 instance store)
*Network card: speed of the card, Public IP
*Firewall rules: security group
*Bootstrap script (configure at first lunch): EC2 user data


-EC2 Instances Types:
* General Purpose
* Compute Optimized
* Memory Optimized
* Storage Optimized
https://instances.vantage.sh/ -> This site offers an extensive comparison of different EC2 instance types, including specifications, pricing, and performance metrics.
                                 It's useful for understanding the differences between instance types and selecting the right one for your needsâ€‹ 

-Security Groups:
Is a set of rules for allowed inbound/outbound traffic to the EC2 instance. 
AWS security groups are stateful: This means that if you allow an incoming connection (inbound rule), the response traffic is automatically allowed (outbound rule) without needing to explicitly define an outbound rule for it, and vice versa.
common ports:
80 - http
443 - https
22 - ssh / sftp
21 - ftp
3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

*Every time you are getting timeout when trying to access your EC2 instance (using SSH or the browser (http/s)) it is most likely related to security group rules. so check out those.

-Connecting to EC2 Instances:

OS	       SSH	Putty	  EC2 Instance Connect
Linux	        V		        V
Mac	        V		        V
Windows <10		  V	        V
Windows >10	V	  V	        V

-How to SSH to the EC2 instance through Mac/Linux/Windwos. 

-When connecting to an EC2 instance through "instance connent" never ever submit your Access keys (security risk + bad practice).
Instead, give IAM roles to your instance. 

-EC2 Instance Purchse Options:
*On-Demand
*Sport Instance
*Reserved Instance
(there are more but these are the main ones)


-Elastic IP: If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need to use Elastic IP which is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you dont delete it.
Overall, try to avoid using Elastic IP:
*They ofter reflect poor architecture decisions
*Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
*Or, use a Load Balancer and don't use a public IP


-EC2 Placement Groups:
*Cluster
*Spread
*Partition

-ENI (Elastic Netwrok Interface):
This is a logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.
