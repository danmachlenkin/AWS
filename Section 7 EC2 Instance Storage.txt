-EBS Volume:
*EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
*It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
*They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
*They are bound to a specific availability zone

Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"

*You can choose to set the root EBS "Delete on Termination" setting to be Yes/No.
Same goes for any new EBS you create. 

-EBS Snapshots:
*Make a backup(snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
*Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
*Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region
*You can create a new volume from a snapshot

-AMI Overview:
*AMI = Amazon Machine Image
*AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance - you add your own software, configuration, OS, monitoring..
*You can launch EC2 instances from: 
   1.A Public AMI: AWS provided
   2.Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
   3.An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made

-EC2 Instance Store:
*EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
*If you need a high performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store:
   1.Better I/) performance
   2.EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped
   3.Good for buffer / cache/scratch data/temporary content

-EBS Volumes Types:
*General Purpose SSD volumes ("gp2"/"gp3")
*Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes (io2 block express 3 / io1)
*Throughput Optimized HDD volumes (st1)
*Cold HDD volumes (sc1)

-EBS Multi-Attach for the io1/io2 family
*Lets you attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ

-EBS Encryption
*When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
1.Data is encrypted inside the volume
2.All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
3.All snapshots are encrypted

*Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)

*Encryption has a minimal impact on latency

*EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS

*Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted
