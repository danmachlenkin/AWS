Amazon RDS
----------


RDS - Relation Database Service

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2:
*RDS is a managed service:
-Automated provisioning, OS patching
-Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp
-Monitoring dashboards
-Read replicas for improved read performance
-Multi AZ setup for DR(Disaster Recovery)
-Maintenance windows for upgrades
-Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
-Storage back by EBS

*But - there is not was to SSH into RDS 

-RDS has storage auto scaling

-RDS read replicas for read scalability:
*up to 15 read replicas
*Within AZ / Cross AZ / or Cross Region
*Replication is ASYNC so read are eventually consistent
*Replicas can be promoted to their own DB

-RDS Multi AZ(Disaster Recovery)
*Creating an "stand by" db in a different AZ within the same Region.
*Automatic failover

-RDS vs RDS Custom:
RDS: entire database and the OS is managed by AWS
RDS Custom: full admin access to the underlying OS and the database (only for Oracle & Microsoft SQL Server Database) via SSH.


RDS & Aurora Restore options:
-Restoring a RDS / Aurora backup or a snapshot - create a new database
-Restoring MySQL RDS database from S3 - create a backup and store it on S3

RDS & AUrora Security:
*At rest encryption:
-DB master & replicas encryption using AWS KMS - must be defined at launch time
-If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
-To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted

*In-flight encryption: TLS- ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side 
*IAM AuthenticationL IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/pw)
*Security Groups: Control network access to your RDS
*No SSH Available except on "RDS Custom"
*Audit logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch

-RDS Proxy:
*Fully managed DB Proxy for RDS
*Allows apps to pool and share DB connections established with the database
*Improving DB efficiency by reducing the stress on DB resources and minimize open connections (and timeouts)
*Severless,autoscaling,highly available(multi-AZ)
*Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up 66%
*Enforce IAM authentication for DB and securely store credentials in AWS secrets manager
*RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)
